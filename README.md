<h1>Indonesian Value Added Tax (VAT) Calculator</h1>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
I'm an acocuntant who trying to learn data analysis, I make this program mainly to learn and familiarize myself with python, but feel free to use it.
<br/>
<br/>

<h3>Assumption</h3>
1. The VAT rate are 11% based on Undang-Undang Nomor 7 tahun 2021 tentang Harmonisasi Peraturan Perpajakan, Bab IV Pasal 7 ayat (1) tentang PPN,<br/>
2. The VAT are excluded from the amount paid.
<br/>
<br/>

<h3>How to Use it</h3>
Pretty straightforward, just enter the amount of the tax base when the program ask for "DPP", which is short from "Dasar Pengenaan Pajak" or tax base in Indonesian language, the program then will using the tax base amount to calculate the amount of the VAT and display the result.

<br/>

<h3>Planned Feature</h3>
1. In 2025 the tax rate will be increased fo 1% so the tax rate becom 12%, I'll update the formula when the tax rate officialy change by Indonesian Government
2. For now the program assume that the tax are excluded from the tax base, I'll add option so the program can calculate both include and exclude tax amount.
